                <p>
                    Recently, I've been wrestling with a few questions: Who am I? What should I do? Why do I work?
                    And in an era where a major cycle may be turning, how can I live better?
                </p>
                <p>
                    These questions seem scattered, but I've gradually realized they all point to the same core:
                    I need a direction that allows for long-term accumulation and creates optionality.
                </p>

                <h2>1. My Understanding of "Cycles": Nesting and Resonance</h2>
                <p>
                    I increasingly believe that changes in the real world aren't driven by a single factor,
                    but are the result of multiple overlapping cycles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Political cycles</strong> are like the longest wavelength—they determine rules, order, and boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beneath political cycles, there are multiple <strong>economic cycles</strong>: growth, recession,
                    recovery, reflation—these changes repeat continuously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beneath economic cycles, there are even shorter <strong>inventory cycles</strong>: supply-demand
                    imbalances, restocking and destocking, price fluctuations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cycles occasionally "resonate" at certain moments, creating the macro environment and
                    individual life experiences we observe today. My intuition tells me that we're currently standing
                    at a turning point in the political cycle: the beginning of a new order challenging the old.
                    In this context, conflicts and frictions will increase, change will accelerate, and certainty will diminish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This raises a practical question: If the external environment becomes more unstable,
                    how should I live better?
                </p>

                <h2>2. Competition and Profit: Why I Started Looking for a Niche Market</h2>
                <p>
                    I recently learned an interesting perspective: "Competition is for losers."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combined with economics' description of perfectly competitive markets, I can understand the logic:
                    in perfect competition, long-term profit margins are continuously compressed, eventually approaching zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I'm in a highly homogenized, easily replaceable track, I might forever be trapped in a cycle of
                    "work a little harder, grind a little more," unable to achieve real excess returns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I'm increasingly certain: what I need isn't "finding a hot track and competing fiercely,"
                    but finding a niche where I can accumulate long-term value—something others are unwilling to do
                    or can't do well.
                </p>

                <h2>3. From Macro to Personal: I Need Optionality, Not Predictions</h2>
                <p>
                    When I put "cycle turning points" and "competition compressing profits" together,
                    I arrive at a more personal conclusion:
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an era of dramatic change, the most important thing for individuals isn't betting correctly
                    on a macro direction, but building a capability that ensures you still have space, fallback options,
                    and choices amid change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, "optionality" comes from three things:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Not losing your rhythm due to a single fluctuation
                        (cash flow, health, psychological resilience).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transferable capabilities:</strong> Skills and work that can travel with you,
                        not being locked to a single organization, region, or industry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verifiable value:</strong> Continuously delivering visible results,
                        rather than just describing achievements on a resume.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. What I Can Do Now: Building Accumulative Assets Through Output</h2>
                <p>
                    I realized that I've too easily stayed in the realm of "thinking" and "learning,"
                    lacking an external vehicle to transform my thoughts into assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I'm preparing to start something simple but effective in the long term: writing a blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, blogging isn't about decoration—it's about achieving three goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organizing chaotic inputs into structured outputs (training expression and thinking).</li>
                    <li>Turning skills and projects into presentable work (training delivery and reusability).</li>
                    <li>Giving myself more explanatory power and more choices when future opportunities arise
                        (building personal narrative and credibility).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is also why I recently started considering building a personal website, learning deployment,
                    and understanding proxy/network tools—I want to turn "output" into a stable system,
                    not just occasional inspiration.
                </p>

                <h2>5. A Tentative Direction: Building "Accumulative Infrastructure" Amid Change</h2>
                <p>
                    If I compress all these thoughts into one sentence:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    I hope that in an era of major cycle transitions, I can live not by betting, not by grinding,
                    but by continuously accumulating transferable, verifiable capabilities.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    One direction I'm currently thinking about: using my familiar tech stack to do work that
                    "others can't live without, but aren't willing to do long-term"—like turning chaotic data
                    into structure, turning systems from "runnable" to "stable," turning results from data into explanations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These capabilities may not always be the most glamorous, but they're often more cycle-resistant
                    and easier to form into your own niche.
                </p>
